#### Thesis

**Master's Thesis** (Excellent Thesis Award)

* Thesis Title: *Research on Vibration Mechanism of Dual-rotor System of Aero-engine with Coupling Fault*
* Description: *Both a simulation model and an experimental set-up were established to explore the vibration mechanism of a fault aero-engine dual-rotor bearing system. In the simulation, the finite element method and the HB-AFT method were utilized to model and solve the ODEs governing the motion of the system. Furthermore, the fault parameter sensitivity was analyzed based on the frequency spectrum, time series, Poincare section, and bifurcation theory.*

**Bachelor's Thesis** (Excellent Thesis Award)

* Thesis Title: *Modeling and Vibration Suppression of Rotor-bearing System of Large Rotating Machinery*
